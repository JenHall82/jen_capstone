For this project I will be looking into the 2022 Tennessee Educator Survey and the 2022 assessment scores for the state of Tennessee.  I will be comparing the level of educator satisfaction or dissatisfaction to the test scores to determine if there is any correlation.  The surveys are written so that all of the 'Strongly Agree' answers show a positive feeling toward the educator's job while the 'Strongly Disagree' show a negative feeling.  The data gives a percentage of teachers per district that answered each prompt with one of the four categories('Strongly Disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly Agree').  I am choosing, for the most part, to focus on the 'Strongly Agree' and 'Agree' categories as they show the most satisfied among them. 

I will be using the TNReady scores from ELA and Math which cover grades 3-8 and ACT scores from high school levels.  


The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that some 300,000 teachers left the profession from February to May in 2022. The average SAT score in 2022 was at its lowest since changing formats in 2016. I will be examining the Middle Tennessee area and attempting to find if a correlation exists between teacher satisfaction and test scores. I will be using data from www.tn.gov, and www.ed.gov.

I spent six years in a public elementary school working alongside teachers and students. I witnessed the difficulties teachers are facing and the pressure put on students to perform. I wish to prove that a happy teacher is a more successful teacher.

Do “happier” Tennessee teachers produce better test scores? Test scores and faculty surveys are available at tn.gov.  I will investigate areas of high and low teacher satisfaction and compare test scores in those areas.


My capstone will show the relationship between teacher satisfaction and their students’ test scores by providing a variety of visualizations that will include interactive charts and maps. I will present with a dashboard and slides. I intend for the audience to be the decision makers of our education system.

 I have examined some of the data available and one major challenge will be cleaning the survey data and deciding how to calculate a standard satisfaction rate.  
 The amount of data will also have to be narrowed down enough to be workable but also show a clear result.
